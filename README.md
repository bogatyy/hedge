# Hedge

Hedge is a set of smart contracts providing decentralized financial derivatives of ERC-20 tokens.
The first (and simplest) step is short-sells for [Bancor-compatible](https://www.bancor.network/static/bancor_protocol_whitepaper_en.pdf) tokens because they are always immediately liquid and provide a trusted on-chain price feed.

## DEMO
A fully functional smart contract for lending BNT is deployed at https://etherscan.io/address/0x2d820ea3a6b9302c500feeb7f6361ba1ddfa5aba#readContract
Verify the [source code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2d820ea3a6b9302c500feeb7f6361ba1ddfa5aba#code) and lend other people your BNT (or take me up on the offer of 10 BNT that I put out!) using [MyEtherWallet](myetherwallet.com), depending on whether you feel bullish or bearish.

If you don't want to risk real Ether, a play-money token is deployed at: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf77cead5b85f379aa7b9031a842ccd903d7966a7#readContract
